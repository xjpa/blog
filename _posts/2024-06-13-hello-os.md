Here's a fast dip towards starting out with OS development

<!-- more -->

# setup

To make sure we're on the same architecture here, we'll create the following folders inside our project directory, which we'll call `hello_os`

```bash
$ mkdir -p hello_os/{boot,src,build}
```

# bootloader

The bootloader initializes the system and loads the kernel

It basically prepares the system and loads the kernel into memory

Create a `boot/boot.asm`

```nasm
[org 0x7c00]
[bits 16]

section code

.init:
    mov eax, 0xb800
    mov es, ax
    mov eax, 0

.main:
    mov byte [es:0x00], 'H'
    mov byte [es:0x01], 0x30

.clear:
    mov byte [es:eax], 0
    inc eax
    mov byte [es:eax], 0x30
    inc eax
    cmp eax, 2 * 25 * 80
    jl .clear

hello:
    mov esi, hello_str
    mov edi, 0x02
.print:
    lodsb
    or al, al
    jz .done
    mov [es:edi], al
    inc edi
    mov byte [es:edi], 0x07
    inc edi
    jmp .print
.done:
    jmp $

hello_str db 'hello', 0

times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0x00

db 0x55
db 0xaa
```

What does this do?

It basically initializes the [VGA text buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_text_mode), clears the screen, and then prints the string "hello" at the top left corner

The bootloader is 512 bytes long, ending with the boot signature 0x55AA, which the BIOS requires to boot from this sector. 512 bytes is the byte limit for a disk sector which is the smallest unit of data taht can be read from a disk by the BIOS during boot process. The emulator we'll use later (QEMU) emulaetes that process.

# bootloader code

There's a lot to unpack for the code above, so let's start

```nasm
[org 0x7c00]
[bits 16]

section code
```

# compile the bootloader

Use NASM to assemble the bootloader

```bash
$ nasm -f bin boot/boot.asm -o build/boot.bin
```

- nasm -f bin: assemble in binary format

- -o build/boot.bin: output the binary file to build/boot.bin

# create the kernel

The kernel's the main part of the OS, and is responsible for managing hardware and basic system functions. BUt the one we have here will jsut be basic, with the kernel code just creating an infinite loop to keep it running

Create `src/kernel.c`

```c
int main()
{

    while (1)
        ;
    return 0;
}
```

# compile the kernel

```bash
$ x86_64-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -c src/kernel.c -o build/kernel.o
```

- x86_64-elf-gcc: the cross-compiler for x86_64 architecture

- -m32: compile for 32-bit mode

- -ffreestanding: compile without assuming standard libraries or startup files

- -c: compile only, do not link

- -o build/kernel.o: output object file

# create the kernel

The linker combines object files into an executable or binary

A linker script defines how sections of code are placed in memory

Create `link.ld`:

```
SECTIONS
{
    . = 0x1000;
    .text : { *(.text) }
    .data : { *(.data) }
    .bss  : { *(.bss)  }
}
```

- `SECTIONS`: defines how sections of the code are placed in memory

- `.`: set the start address to 0x1000

- `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`: defines sections for code, initialized data, and uninitialized data.

# link the kernel

```bash
$ x86_64-elf-ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o build/kernel.elf build/kernel.o
```

- `x86_64-elf-ld`: cross-linker for x86_64 architecture

- `-m elf_i386`: use the ELF format for 32-bit

- `-T link.ld`: use the linker script

- `-o build/kernel.elf`: output the ELF file

# convert ELF to binary

An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file needs to be converted to a raw binary format to be loaded by the bootloader.

Convert the ELF file to a binary:

```bash
$ x86_64-elf-objcopy -O binary build/kernel.elf build/kernel.bin
```

- `x86_64-elf-objcopy`: this is the tool to convert object files

- `-O binary`: output in binary format

# combine bootloader and kernel into an OS Image

Concatenate the bootloader and kernel binary into a single OS image:

```bash
$ cat build/boot.bin build/kernel.bin > build/os_image.bin
```

- `cat`: concatenate the files

- `build/boot.bin build/kernel.bin`: input files

- `> build/os_image.bin`: output the OS image

# run the OS with QEMU

QEMU is an emulator that allows you to run your OS without needing physical hardware.

```bash
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os_image.bin
```

- `qemu-system-x86_64`: QEMU emulator for x86_64 architecture

- `-drive format=raw,file=build/os_image.bin`: specify the raw format and OS image file

# that's it

This is a very tiny demonstration of operating systems development

It just comprises of a basic bootloader and a minimal kernel that keeps the system running. So its not yet a fully functional OS. No features like multitasking, file systems, device drivers, etc. But it does serve as a foundation for building a more complex OS, as you can incrementally add more features to it like maybe staart with some basic console output.

To add, "compiling" the OS takes a lot of steps for exmaple for this demo project we had to:

1. compile bootloader with nasm
2. compile kernel with gcc
3. link kernel with x86_64-elf-ld
4. convert ELF to binary with x86_64-elf-objcopy
5. cat bootloader and kernel to an OS image
6. run OS: qemu-system-x86_64

So it's best to make your own makefile

Initially, when youre beginning, at least in my case, one of the biggest time wasters is the toolchain, especially if youre on a mac like me it's going to take you hours of messing around figuring out what's wrong. Especially the compiler, assembler, linker to build the OS.

So my post is only geared for macOS users, I have not tried them on a linux or windows
