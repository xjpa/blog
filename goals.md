# Kind of like a bucket list I guess

- See Antarctica: the tours at gadventures.com look good

- Don't be a programmer/tech all your life: Maybe go to law school? Or Medicine? Or culinary arts? Or be a scuba dive instructor? Just try exploring a career outside of being a software engineer once in my life.
